# How I came to STEM Education

- Science teacher (in Cleveland Co., NC)
- Interested in *context* and educational technology (at MSU)
- Worked on a science education research project focused on modeling
- Used ESM to study how learners engaged in scientific and engineering practices
- Became interested in the role of data when engaging in scientific and engineering practices
- Assistant Prof. of STEM Education at UT

# Focus on data science education

- *[Subject matter] education* implies a focus on teaching & learning
- Especially important if aim is to work at the K-12 level
    - Uncommon
    - Can be empowering to learners
    - Turns the tables

# The provenance of data science education

- *Education*
    - Data modeling (Lehrer & Romberg, 1996)
    - Studies of statistical reasoning (Wild & Pfannkuch)

- *Statistics*
    - Breiman (2001)
    - Donoho (2017)

- *Data science practice*
    - Erickson (2017-2018)
    - McNamara (2016)
    
- *Curriculum reform documents*
    - NGSS Lead States (2013) and National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, 2010)

# What's not a dilemma?

- Working with data *is* empowering
- Young children *can* do data science
- Equity *is* a first principle

# What is a data science education dilemma?

---

# Modeling data science education dilemmas 

- Generated dilemmas
- Received feedback from a peer
- Grouped into three themes (as a preliminary model for these dilemmas):
    - Purpose
    - Pedagogy
    - Policy
    
---

# Purpose

- Unplugged vs. with (computational) tools
- Mastering one (computational) tool vs. learning general principles
- Use of explanatory vs. predictive models
- Creating data vs. using existing data sets

---

# Pedagogy

- Focus on modeling and visualizing data vs. creating and structuring data
- Tools for learning vs. real tools
- Taught as part of math and science courses vs. part of statistics or computer science courses

---

# Policy

- Resource-intensive tools vs. access and expense
- Undergraduate and advanced degree vs. K-12

---

# What are some opportunities?

---

# Opportunities 

- Some existing curricula (may need to be adapted)
- Lots of attention in industry and at post-secondary level
- Rare area of overlap between math and science standards
- Goal-directed use of engineering and computer science ideas
- Demanding, open-ended, potentially meaningful
- Some strong equity focus among some practitioners
- Not as commercially-oriented as computer science education initiative

---

# Some examples to follow

- Wilkerson
- Victor Lee
- Sengupta
- Hollylynne Lee
- Hodge and Bartlett
- Anderson
- Motsipak
